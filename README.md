# Diamond Kata
This is a console application created as a solution to the diamon kata challenge.

The app asks the user to enter a letter in the alphabet and outputs a diamond, with the entered character being the midpoint of the diamond.
The app includes input validation and unit tests to ensure the functionality works as intended
